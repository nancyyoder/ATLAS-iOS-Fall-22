# App Idea

My app idea is a dating app called "Polls".

I really enjoy answering random Instagram polls. The process of choosing a side and seeing the percentage of people that also chose that side or chose the other side is satisfying.

On the app Polls, you vote "thumbs up" or "thumbs down" on random poll topics: dogs, cats, beans, tacos, summer, winter, beaches. When you vote on a poll you can see the percentages of the results at that moment. You are then suggested profiles of other users with similar answers as yours. They are shown to you in order of how similar they are to you, and provide some information about the user, like their photo and bio. Your profile will also have fun facts about you, like an "unpopular opinion", if you fall in a minority vote of less than 20%.

Instead of swiping on pictures of people, you are swiping on decisions you have to make for yourself, and the app will pair you with some potential matches, who you can then choose to start a conversation with. 

I think this is a good app idea within the scope of this class because it is easily scalable. If I don't have enough time to implement the dating portion of this app i can just do the polls part which would still be fun and engaging. After playing around on Xcode, I do think I could code implement the polls interface.
